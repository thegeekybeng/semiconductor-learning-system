## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and settings
   ```

3. **Initialize Database**:

   ```bash
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```

4. **Start the System**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

The system uses environment variables for configuration. Key settings include:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For LLM integration
- `CHROMA_DB_PATH`: Vector database storage path
- `CRAWL_SCHEDULE`: Schedule for automated crawling
- `MAX_CRAWL_DEPTH`: Maximum crawling depth
- `UPDATE_FREQUENCY`: Model update frequency

## Usage

### Manual Data Collection

```bash
python scripts/crawl_sources.py --source semiconductor_news
```

### Query the Knowledge Base

```bash
python scripts/query.py "How has EUV lithography evolved in the last decade?"
```

### Start Automated Learning

```bash
python scripts/start_scheduler.py
```
